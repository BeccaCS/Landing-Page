      <h2>5 Facts about dogs.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A dog's nose print is unique, much like a person's fingerprint.</li>
        <li>
          Speaking of sleeping â€¦ all dogs dream, but puppies and senior dogs
          dream more frequently than adult dogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          A dog's sense of smell is legendary, but did you know that their nose
          has as many as 300 million receptors? In comparison, a human nose has
          about 5 million.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dogs' noses can sense heat and thermal radiation, which explains why
          blind or deaf dogs can still hunt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dogs curl up in a ball when sleeping to protect their organs â€” a
          holdover from their days in the wild, when they were vulnerable to
          predator attacks.

          <em>Dogs Make Us Feel Less Alone</em>
          <p>
            Dogs can be there for you even when people canâ€™t. They offer
            unconditional love, emotional support, and constant cuddles that
            help stave off social isolation. A small Australian study discovered
            that dog ownership can reduce loneliness.

          <em>Dogs Are Good for Your Heart</em>
          <p>
            Owning a dog can help you live longer. A comprehensive review of
            studies published between 1950 and 2019 found that dog owners had a
            lower risk of death. Studies suggest that dog owners have lower
            blood pressure levels and improved responses to stress. Research has
            concluded that the bond between humans and dogs reduces stress,
            which is a major cause of cardiovascular problems.
